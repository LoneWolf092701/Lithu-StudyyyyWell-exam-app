      "marks": 14,
      "correctAnswer": "Porter's Generic Strategies provide four fundamental approaches to competitive advantage: 1) Cost Leadership - achieving the lowest cost position in the industry through economies of scale, efficient operations, and cost control (examples: Walmart's supply chain efficiency, Southwest Airlines' operational model, IKEA's flat-pack furniture); 2) Differentiation - offering unique products or services that customers value and are willing to pay premium prices for (examples: Apple's design innovation, Tesla's electric vehicle technology, Starbucks' customer experience); 3) Focus Cost Leadership - achieving cost advantages in a narrow market segment (examples: Spirit Airlines in budget travel, Costco in warehouse retail); 4) Focus Differentiation - providing unique value in specific market niches (examples: Rolex in luxury watches, Ferrari in sports cars, Whole Foods in organic groceries). Each strategy requires different organizational capabilities, resources, and management approaches to sustain competitive advantage.",
