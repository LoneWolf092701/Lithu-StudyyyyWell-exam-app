      "question": "Analyze the strategic importance of data quality in organizational decision-making processes. Provide examples of how poor data quality can impact business outcomes.",
      "marks": 12,
      "correctAnswer": "Data quality is strategically critical as it directly impacts decision accuracy, operational efficiency, and competitive advantage. High-quality data enables accurate forecasting, customer insights, risk assessment, and process optimization. Poor data quality leads to: incorrect strategic decisions (Target's failed Canadian expansion due to inventory data issues), customer dissatisfaction from wrong recommendations, financial losses through billing errors, regulatory compliance failures, and reduced trust in analytics systems. Quality dimensions include accuracy (correctness), completeness (all required data present), consistency (uniform across systems), timeliness (current and up-to-date), and validity (conforming to defined formats). Organizations must implement data governance frameworks, establish quality metrics and monitoring, create data stewardship roles, and maintain continuous quality improvement processes. Poor data quality costs organizations an average of $15 million annually according to IBM studies. Strategic decision-making improvements require: evidence-based strategy formulation using reliable data, real-time performance monitoring with accurate metrics, and predictive analytics based on clean datasets.",
