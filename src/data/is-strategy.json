      "question": "Differentiate between the aim and scope of Business Strategy, IS Strategy, and IT Strategy. Analyse the interrelationships and dependencies among these strategies. You may want to utilise a framework or diagram to support your answer.",
      "marks": 15,
      "correctAnswer": "Business Strategy focuses on competitive advantage and market positioning, defining how an organization competes in its chosen markets through value creation and resource allocation. IS Strategy aligns information systems with business objectives, ensuring IT supports business goals through appropriate information flows, data management, and process automation. IT Strategy deals with technology infrastructure, platforms, and technical capabilities including hardware, software, and network architectures. The interrelationships show IS Strategy as a bridge between Business and IT Strategy, with dependencies flowing from business needs through information requirements to technical implementation. Strategic alignment models like Henderson and Venkatraman's framework illustrate these relationships, showing how business strategy drives IS strategy, which in turn influences IT strategy. Dependencies include: business strategy determining information needs, IS strategy defining technology requirements, and IT strategy enabling business capabilities.",

      "question": "Define the concept of 'Information Resource' and explain distinct categories of information resources using real-life examples.",
      "marks": 14,
      "correctAnswer": "Information Resources are organizational assets comprising data, information systems, technology infrastructure, and human expertise used to support business operations, decision-making, and competitive advantage. Categories include: 1) Data Resources - structured and unstructured data like customer databases (Amazon's customer profiles), financial records (bank transaction data), operational data (Uber's ride data); 2) Hardware Resources - physical infrastructure like servers (Google's data centers), networks (Cisco's routing equipment), devices (Apple's iPhone ecosystem); 3) Software Resources - applications (Microsoft Office 365), operating systems (Windows), databases (Oracle); 4) Human Resources - IT staff (programmers, analysts), users (business professionals), consultants (Accenture consultants); 5) Network Resources - internet connectivity, intranets (corporate networks), telecommunications (5G networks). These resources create value through integration and strategic utilization.",

      "question": "Discuss what makes Information Resources valuable from a strategic standpoint.",
      "marks": 10,
      "correctAnswer": "Information Resources become strategically valuable when they satisfy the VRIN framework: Valuable (create economic value), Rare (not easily available to competitors), Inimitable (difficult to replicate), and Non-substitutable (no equivalent alternatives). Strategic value derives from: competitive advantage creation through unique insights, cost reduction via automation and efficiency, revenue enhancement through better customer targeting, market differentiation via superior service delivery, operational efficiency through process optimization, innovation enablement via data analytics, and strategic decision support through business intelligence. Resources must be aligned with business strategy and provide sustainable competitive advantages. Examples include Netflix's recommendation algorithm (rare and inimitable), Amazon's logistics network (valuable and non-substitutable), and Tesla's over-the-air updates (innovative and differentiating).",
