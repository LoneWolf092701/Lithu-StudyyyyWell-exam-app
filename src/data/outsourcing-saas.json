      "question": "Critically evaluate the following statement: 'Given the evident cost advantages of outsourcing, especially through the models such as the Software as a Service (SaaS), insourcing business applications is no longer a sensible choice for organizations.'",
      "marks": 15,
      "correctAnswer": "This statement oversimplifies complex outsourcing decisions and ignores critical strategic considerations. While SaaS offers cost advantages including reduced infrastructure investment, predictable subscription costs, automatic updates, and economies of scale, insourcing remains strategically valuable in several scenarios. Insourcing benefits include: complete control over strategic applications, customization capabilities for unique business processes, data security and compliance control, and development of internal capabilities. Critical evaluation reveals that the choice depends on: strategic importance of the application (core competencies should remain internal), security and compliance requirements (regulated industries may require internal control), customization needs (unique processes may require bespoke solutions), and long-term cost considerations (SaaS can become expensive over time). Examples include: banks keeping core banking systems internal while using SaaS for HR, defense contractors maintaining classified systems internally, and manufacturing companies keeping proprietary production systems in-house. The optimal approach often involves a hybrid strategy balancing outsourcing non-core functions while maintaining control over strategic capabilities.",

      "marks": 12,
      "correctAnswer": "IT outsourcing models vary in scope, control, and strategic implications. Types include: 1) Total Outsourcing - transferring entire IT function to external provider (strategic implications: significant cost savings but loss of internal capabilities); 2) Selective Outsourcing - outsourcing specific functions while retaining others (balanced approach maintaining core capabilities); 3) Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) - entire business processes managed externally (focus on core competencies); 4) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - hardware and basic software managed externally; 5) Platform as a Service (PaaS) - development platforms provided externally; 6) Software as a Service (SaaS) - complete applications delivered as services. Strategic implications encompass: cost structure changes (CAPEX to OPEX), capability development (internal vs. external), risk distribution, and competitive positioning. Success factors include: clear governance structures, robust contracts, performance metrics, and relationship management. Examples include: IBM's total outsourcing deals, selective outsourcing by banks, and Salesforce's SaaS model transformation.",

      "marks": 13,
      "correctAnswer": "Build vs. buy vs. rent decisions require comprehensive evaluation of strategic, financial, and operational factors. Key considerations include: Strategic Importance - core capabilities should be built internally, while non-core functions can be bought or rented; Cost Analysis - total cost of ownership including development, maintenance, and opportunity costs; Time-to-Market - urgency may favor buying or renting over building; Customization Requirements - unique needs may necessitate building while standard requirements suit buying/renting; Risk Tolerance - building carries development risk while buying/renting involves vendor dependency; Organizational Capabilities - technical expertise and resources available for building and maintaining solutions. Financial factors encompass: initial investment requirements, ongoing operational costs, scalability expenses, and return on investment. Operational considerations include: maintenance responsibilities, upgrade management, support requirements, and integration complexity. Examples include: Amazon building AWS internally for competitive advantage, companies buying SAP for ERP needs, and organizations renting Salesforce for CRM functionality. Decision frameworks should evaluate: strategic value, cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, and organizational readiness.",

      "marks": 10,
      "correctAnswer": "Vendor lock-in occurs when switching costs become prohibitively high, creating dependency on specific vendors. Lock-in mechanisms include: proprietary data formats, custom APIs, specialized skills requirements, integration complexities, and contractual constraints. Types encompass: technical lock-in (proprietary technologies), economic lock-in (switching costs), and procedural lock-in (complex migration processes). Risks involve: reduced negotiating power, limited innovation options, potential cost increases, and dependency on vendor stability. Mitigation strategies include: multi-cloud approaches distributing risk across providers, open standards adoption ensuring portability, data portability planning with regular exports, API standardization reducing integration dependencies, and contract negotiations including exit clauses. Technical approaches encompass: containerization for application portability, hybrid architectures maintaining flexibility, and abstraction layers reducing direct dependencies.

      "marks": 12,
      "correctAnswer": "Cloud computing economic models offer different approaches to IT cost management with distinct strategic implications. Pay-per-use models provide: usage-based pricing aligned with actual consumption, cost transparency for resource utilization, elimination of upfront investments, and automatic scaling cost adjustments. Benefits include financial flexibility and cost optimization, while challenges involve unpredictable costs and potential expense spikes. Subscription models offer: predictable monthly/annual costs enabling budget planning, bundled services providing comprehensive solutions, volume discounts for committed usage, and simplified vendor management. Strategic advantages include cost predictability and procurement simplification, while limitations involve paying for unused capacity. Reserved instances combine: significant cost savings through upfront commitments, capacity guarantees for critical workloads, and predictable pricing for stable requirements. Strategic implications encompass: financial planning improvements, cash flow management, and risk reduction for essential services. Hybrid approaches involve: combining models based on workload characteristics, optimizing costs across different usage patterns, and maintaining flexibility while achieving savings. Examples include: startups using pay-per-use for flexibility, enterprises adopting subscriptions for predictability, and established companies leveraging reserved instances for core systems.
